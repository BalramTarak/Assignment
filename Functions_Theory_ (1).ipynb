        "Generators are a special type of iterator in Python that allow you to iterate over a sequence of values lazily, meaning they generate the values on the fly as you need them, rather than storing all the values in memory at once. This makes them memory-efficient, especially when dealing with large datasets or infinite sequences.\n",
        "\n",
        "How Generators Work\n",
        "\n",
        "Generators are defined using functions with the yield keyword, rather than return. Unlike a normal function, which terminates after returning a value, a generator function can pause its execution and resume from where it left off when it is called again.\n",

        "#Q7.What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
        "#Answer Generators offer several advantages over regular functions, particularly when working with large datasets or streaming data. Here's why generators are often more efficient:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Memory Efficiency\n",
        "\n",
        "Generators generate values on the fly, meaning they do not store all values in memory at once. Instead, they yield values one at a time. This makes them ideal for working with large or even infinite sequences.\n",
        "\n",
        "Regular functions, on the other hand, typically return complete data structures (like lists), which can consume a lot of memory, especially with large datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "def count_up_to(n):\n",
        "    return [i for i in range(1, n+1)]  # Regular function: returns a list\n",
        "    \n",
        "def count_up_to_gen(n):\n",
        "    for i in range(1, n+1):\n",
        "        yield i  # Generator: yields values one at a time\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Lazy Evaluation\n",
        "\n",
        "Generators use lazy evaluation, meaning they calculate each value only when it is requested. This can be beneficial when you only need a part of a sequence or when processing very large or infinite data streams.\n",
        "\n",
        "Regular functions compute and return all the values at once, even if you only need a small subset.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "gen = (i * i for i in range(1000))  # Generator expression\n",
        "print(next(gen))  # Will compute only the first value on demand\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Improved Performance with Large Data\n",
        "\n",
        "Since generators don’t compute and store all values upfront, they are faster when handling large datasets. The performance gain comes from avoiding the creation of large data structures and reducing memory pressure.\n",
        "\n",
        "Regular functions take more time and memory upfront as they create and return the entire data structure at once.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Suitability for Infinite Sequences\n",
        "\n",
        "Generators can produce infinite sequences without running out of memory. Since they generate each value on demand, you can iterate indefinitely over a generator without having to store all the values in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "Regular functions are impractical for infinite sequences as they try to return a complete list, which would cause memory overflow.\n",

        "Example:\n",

        "\n",
        "infinite_gen = infinite_sequence()  # Infinite generator, no memory issues\n",
        "\n",
        "5. State Retention Between Iterations\n",
        "\n",
        "Generators automatically retain their state between each call to next(). This allows them to resume execution from where they left off after yielding a value. This simplifies the code needed to implement stateful computations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Regular functions don’t retain state between calls. You would need additional mechanisms (like global variables) to keep track of state.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Simpler Code for Iterative Algorithms\n",
        "\n",
        "Generators provide a simpler and more intuitive way to write iterative algorithms. You can pause and resume the function at each yield, avoiding the need to write complex logic to handle state and iteration.\n",
        "\n",
        "Regular functions often require external loops and additional logic to achieve the same behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "def fibonacci():\n",

        "    while True:\n",
        "        yield a\n",
        "        a, b = b, a + b  # Resumes from this point on each call\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Enhanced Modularity\n",
        "\n",
        "Generators make it easy to chain operations. Since they produce one value at a time, you can compose generators together to create complex processing pipelines without needing to create intermediate data structures.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "def double_values(nums):\n",
        "    for num in nums:\n",
        "        yield num * 2\n",

        "Summary of Advantages:\n",
        "\n",
        "Memory efficient for large datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "Lazy evaluation: values are produced only when needed.\n",
