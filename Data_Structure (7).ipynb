        "\n",
        "1. Unordered: Sets do not maintain the order of elements. When you print a set, the order of elements might not be the same as the order in which you added them.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Unique Elements: Sets automatically remove duplicate values. Every element in a set is unique.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Mutable: While the elements in a set must be immutable (such as numbers, strings, tuples), the set itself is mutable, meaning you can add or remove items from it.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "4. No Indexing or Slicing: Sets do not support indexing, slicing, or other sequence-like behavior because they are unordered.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Efficient Membership Testing: Checking whether an element is in a set (using in keyword) is faster than in lists due to the underlying hash table implementation.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Union: Combines elements from two sets, eliminating duplicates.\n",
        "\n",
        "Intersection: Returns elements common to both sets.\n",
        "\n",
        "Difference: Returns elements in one set that are not in the other.\n",
        "\n",
        "Symmetric Difference: Returns elements that are in either of the sets but not in both.\n",
        "\n",

        "In Python, dictionary keys must be immutable because they are used in hashing operations. When you use a key in a dictionary, Python applies a hashing function to the key to determine where it should store the associated value. Immutable objects like strings, numbers, and tuples have a fixed hash value during their lifetime, which ensures that their position in the hash table remains consistent.\n",
